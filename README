NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::OSPrereqs::Prefix - List prereqs conditional on
    operating system

VERSION
    version 0.004

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

       [OSPrereqs::Prefix / !MSWin32]
       Proc::ProcessTable=0

    Some prefixes are recognized, i.e. C<!> (not), C<~> (regex match), C<!~>
    (regex non-match). Regex matches are done case-insensitively for
    convenience:

       ; require on non-Win32 system
       [OSPrereqs::Prefix / !MSWin32]
       Proc::ProcessTable = 0.50
 
       ; require on BSD
       [OSPrereqs::Prefix / ~bsd]
       BSD::Resource=0
 
       ; require on non-Windows system
       [OSPrereqs::Prefix / !win]
       Proc::ProcessTable = 0.50

DESCRIPTION
    Note: this distribution is released as a separate distribution to
    DZP::OSPrereqs. A patch/pull request is also sent to DZP::OSPrereqs.

    This Dist::Zilla plugin allows you to specify OS-specific prerequisites.
    You must give the plugin a name corresponding to an operating system
    that would appear in $^O. Any prerequisites listed will be conditionally
    added to "PREREQ_PM" in the Makefile.PL

WARNING
    This plugin works for Makefile.PL generated by the
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker plugin or the Build.PL generated by the
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ModuleBuild plugin, and must appear in your
    dist.ini after whichever you use.

    This plugin is a fairly gross hack, based on the technique used for
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::DualLife and might break if/when Dist::Zilla
    changes how it generates install scripts.
